# Client Standups

Documentation: Work in progress
Frequency: Weekly
Nature: CS
Owner: Brian Adjei-Otchwemah
Status: In Discovery

### Why does the process matter

CS-Ops is to ensure that stand-ups are frequently shared with client instances on client slack channels. This gives the client a regular update of PR in progress and PR to be reviewed by them. It is an overview of what's happening on their instance async. 

- **Communication**: PR and Ticket status are visible for clients real-time
- **Evidence:** relay back to standup details when misunderstanding/miscommunication occurs

### Execution journal

*Frequency: twice a week* 

*What's the deliverable?* 

1. Duplicate a new check date column from the last check date column on db below
2. Follow the workflow below to check on each instance of standup 
3. Tick-box each instance after a check is completed 

*How will you verify it's done well?*

1. Sample client instance Slack channels to validate

### How to execute the process?

1. For every active client (cf [](https://www.notion.so/745908688d94400a8404d69adcf8b3bc)), except for Coherent projects
    - For Coherent instances, we currently do not use slack channel for updating stand-ups. PMs will have to manually post on Coherent Teams Channel to update. There's currently no effective process for checks and client communication.
2. Go to Slack channel to find corresponding client-shared channels for each client project
3. Ensure you are logged into slack with the Client Success Slack ID. Once logged in to slack use the account for this task. 
4. Run these two checks:

A) **Standups aren't skipped**

1. If a client standup hasn't been posted for over 3 business days, flag the TPM and ping @Edward So @Mert Yerekapan 
    
    *add text to copy paste - save time!
    Always use the client success slack account for these checks.*

**B) Standup make sense:** 

Ensure all standups shared are linked to a PR. Click on that PR link and review internal comments. Also ensure what they say are in_progress and under_review tally with that in our DB. We want this Data to be clear across board. 

**Good stand-up examples**  

- SourceGraph - standup is clear and not too bulk, with action items on client side **(Tickets Under Client Review)**, and action items on GitStart side **(Tickets In Progress)**
